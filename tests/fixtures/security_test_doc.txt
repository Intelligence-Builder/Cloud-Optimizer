Security Assessment Report for AWS Infrastructure
================================================

Executive Summary
-----------------
This report documents critical security findings and compliance requirements
for our AWS cloud infrastructure. Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified
that require immediate remediation.

Vulnerability Findings
----------------------

1. Critical Vulnerability CVE-2023-44487 - HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack
   Severity: CRITICAL SEVERITY
   CVSS Score: CVSS 10.0
   Description: HTTP/2 protocol vulnerability affecting web servers and load balancers.
   The vulnerability CVE-2023-44487 allows attackers to perform denial of service
   attacks against HTTP/2 enabled services.

   Affected Resources:
   - Application Load Balancer: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/prod-alb/50dc6c495c0c9188
   - CloudFront Distribution: arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/E1XAMPLE

   Mitigation: WAF mitigates HTTP/2 rapid reset attacks through rate limiting rules.

2. High Severity Issue - Exposed S3 Buckets
   Severity: HIGH RISK
   CVSS: 8.5
   Description: Multiple S3 buckets configured with public read access without
   proper access policies.

   Resources:
   - arn:aws:s3:::prod-data-bucket
   - arn:aws:s3:::backup-logs-2023

   Remediation: Security group secures the bucket access and IAM policy restricts
   read permissions to authorized principals only.

3. Medium Priority - Encryption Configuration Gap
   Severity: MEDIUM PRIORITY
   Description: Several RDS instances lack encryption at rest configuration.

   Current State: Database instances using AES-128 encryption, but best practice
   recommends AES-256 encryption with AWS KMS integration.

   Affected Resources:
   - arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:prod-mysql-01
   - arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:analytics-postgres

   Solution: TLS 1.3 protects data in transit, and KMS encryption defends data at rest.

Compliance Requirements
-----------------------

SOC 2 Type II Compliance
The infrastructure must comply with SOC 2 security controls. Current compliance
gaps identified:
- Access policy rules need strengthening for SOC2 requirements
- Audit logging must meet SOC 2 standards

HIPAA Compliance
For healthcare data processing, HIPAA requirements mandate:
- Encryption of PHI using AES-256 or RSA-2048
- Network Security Group (NSG) controls for data isolation
- IAM role assignment following principle of least privilege

PCI-DSS Requirements
Payment card data requires PCI-DSS certification:
- TLS 1.2 minimum for data in transit
- Security group sg-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890 protecting payment processing instances
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for cardholder data access

GDPR Data Privacy
European customer data subject to GDPR regulations:
- Data residency in EU regions
- Encryption key management via HSM
- Permission policy attached to data processing roles

Identity and Access Management
--------------------------------

Current IAM Configuration:
- IAM policy configuration defines resource access boundaries
- Multiple IAM roles with overly broad permissions identified
- Access policy needs alignment with NIST security framework

Recommended Actions:
1. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) across all services
2. Configure security groups with least privilege principles
3. Enable MFA for all IAM users: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/admin
4. Rotate access keys and SSL certificates quarterly

Network Security
----------------

VPC Security Groups:
- Security group sg-1234abcd configured for web tier
- Network security group rules need review for compliance
- Firewall safeguards the production VPC perimeter

Encryption Standards:
- RSA-4096 key pairs for SSH access
- SSL 3.0 deprecated, migrating to TLS 1.3 protocol
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for key management

Vulnerability Patch addresses CVE-2023-12345 in OpenSSL library used by
EC2 instances.

Additional Security Findings
-----------------------------

Low Impact Issues:
- Informational severity findings from AWS GuardDuty
- Security best practices recommendations for CloudTrail logging
- ISO 27001 controls alignment opportunities

Critical Actions Required:
1. Patch remediates the OpenSSL vulnerability CVE-2023-12345
2. This control mitigates SQL injection risks in web applications
3. Encryption reduces data exposure risk for customer PII
4. Firewall protects backend database instances from internet access

Compliance Summary
------------------
- FedRAMP authorization in progress
- CIS benchmarks partially implemented
- CCPA compliance requirements documented
- ISO27001 certification planned for Q2 2024
- FISMA controls under review

Conclusion
----------
Immediate action required to address critical severity vulnerabilities and
compliance gaps. The vulnerability CVE-2024-0001 discovered in container
runtime requires urgent patching. RBAC implementation addresses access
control requirements across all compliance frameworks.
