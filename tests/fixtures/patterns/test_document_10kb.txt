Security Assessment Report - Cloud Infrastructure Analysis
==========================================================

Executive Summary
-----------------
This security assessment identifies critical vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure
deployed on AWS. The analysis covers EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM configurations,
and network security groups.

Critical Findings
-----------------

1. CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack)
   Severity: Critical (CVSS 7.5)
   Affected Systems: Load balancers and API gateways
   Remediation: Update to patched versions immediately
   Cost Impact: Estimated $50,000 in potential downtime costs

2. CVE-2023-38545 (curl SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow)
   Severity: High (CVSS 9.8)
   Affected Systems: All containers using curl 7.69.0-8.3.0
   Remediation: Upgrade curl to version 8.4.0 or later
   Timeline: Patch within 24 hours

3. Misconfigured S3 Bucket Permissions
   Severity: Medium
   Risk: Public read access enabled on 3 buckets
   Buckets Affected:
   - prod-logs-bucket (contains 500GB of logs)
   - backup-data-store (contains database backups)
   - static-assets-cdn (contains public assets - acceptable)

IAM Security Analysis
---------------------

Finding: Overly permissive IAM policies detected
- 15 users have Administrator access (should be < 5)
- 23 service accounts with wildcard permissions
- No MFA enforced for 40% of console users
- Last access review: 180 days ago (policy requires 90 days)

Recommendation: Implement least privilege principle
Timeline: Complete within 30 days
Cost: $25,000 for IAM restructuring project

Network Security Assessment
---------------------------

Security Groups Analysis:
- 12 security groups allow 0.0.0.0/0 ingress on SSH (port 22)
- 5 security groups have unrestricted ICMP access
- 3 security groups allow all traffic between VPCs

VPC Configuration:
- Flow logs enabled: Yes (compliant)
- NAT Gateway redundancy: No (risk)
- Private subnets: 8 configured correctly
- Public subnets: 4 with internet gateway

Compliance Status
-----------------

SOC 2 Type II: 85% compliant
- Gap: Access review process not documented
- Gap: Incident response plan needs update
- Timeline: Remediation by Q2 2024

PCI-DSS: 72% compliant
- Gap: Encryption at rest not enabled on 2 databases
- Gap: Key rotation not automated
- Gap: Log retention policy not enforced
- Timeline: Critical - remediate within 14 days

HIPAA: Not applicable (no PHI processed)

Performance Metrics
-------------------

Current Infrastructure Costs: $125,000/month
Potential Savings Identified: $35,000/month (28%)

Optimization Opportunities:
1. Right-size 45 over-provisioned EC2 instances
   Savings: $18,000/month

2. Convert 20 on-demand instances to reserved
   Savings: $12,000/month

3. Implement S3 lifecycle policies
   Savings: $3,000/month

4. Remove 15 unused EBS volumes
   Savings: $2,000/month

Incident History (Last 90 Days)
-------------------------------

- 2023-10-15: DDoS attack mitigated (15 minutes downtime)
- 2023-10-22: Unauthorized access attempt blocked
- 2023-11-01: Certificate expiration caused API outage (2 hours)
- 2023-11-10: Database failover triggered (automatic recovery)

Risk Assessment Matrix
----------------------

| Threat Category      | Likelihood | Impact  | Risk Score |
|---------------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Data Breach         | Medium     | High    | 7.5        |
| DDoS Attack         | High       | Medium  | 6.0        |
| Insider Threat      | Low        | High    | 5.5        |
| Ransomware          | Medium     | Critical| 8.5        |
| Supply Chain Attack | Low        | High    | 5.0        |

Recommendations Summary
-----------------------

Priority 1 (Immediate - within 24 hours):
- Patch CVE-2023-38545 on all containers
- Restrict S3 bucket permissions
- Enable MFA for all IAM users

Priority 2 (Within 7 days):
- Update security groups to restrict SSH access
- Implement NAT Gateway redundancy
- Configure automated key rotation

Priority 3 (Within 30 days):
- Complete IAM policy restructuring
- Update incident response plan
- Implement cost optimization changes
