  "body": "## Parent Epic\nPart of Epic 9: Advanced Security Scanning (#127)\n\n## Objective\nEnable Cloud Optimizer to scan multiple AWS accounts simultaneously with centralized result aggregation and account relationship management.\n\n## Requirements\n- Support scanning multiple AWS accounts from single control plane\n- Manage account credentials and access methods\n- Aggregate scan results across all accounts\n- Track account metadata (account ID, name, environment, business unit)\n- Support different authentication methods per account\n- Handle account-level errors gracefully without failing entire scan\n- Provide account-level result filtering and reporting\n- Support scheduling scans for different accounts\n- Track scan history and compliance posture per account\n\n## Features to Implement\n- Account registry for managing multiple accounts\n- Credential management (IAM roles, access keys, assume role)\n- Multi-threaded/async scanning for performance\n- Result aggregation with account context\n- Account grouping (by environment, business unit, etc.)\n- Centralized dashboard showing all accounts\n- Account-level compliance scoring\n- Differential scanning (detect changes between scans)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Account registry database schema implemented\n- [ ] API endpoints for account management (add, update, delete, list)\n- [ ] Multi-account scanner orchestrator implemented\n- [ ] Concurrent scanning with configurable thread pool\n- [ ] Results properly tagged with account context\n- [ ] Dashboard shows all accounts with summary statistics\n- [ ] Account-level filtering in UI and API\n- [ ] Error handling prevents cascade failures\n- [ ] Unit tests cover account management (>80% coverage)\n- [ ] Integration test validates multi-account scanning\n- [ ] Documentation for account setup and management\n- [ ] Scanner performance: 10+ accounts in parallel\n\n## Technical Approach\n- Database schema: accounts table with credentials and metadata\n- Use boto3 STS for assume role authentication\n- Implement ThreadPoolExecutor or asyncio for concurrent scanning\n- Result schema includes account_id as required field\n- Centralized error handling and retry logic\n- UI: Account selector/filter component\n\n## Estimated Effort\n24-28 hours\n\n## Dependencies\n- Database schema migration\n- AWS STS API access\n- Cross-account IAM roles (setup documentation)\n- Updated result aggregation logic",
